    <p>"When you are doing something that you think is right, just believe in yourself and go with it."
      Greetings, myself Karan Vohra. I believe myself to have an optimistic and ambitious
      perspective towards life. In my leisure time, I like to play outdoors, watch movies, listen to music and read. My
      preferred genre is fantasy. I have always had a passion for reading but the Covid era has allowed me to enjoy it
      even more. I aspire to be a doctor someday to provide happiness to as many people possible. Here are the other
