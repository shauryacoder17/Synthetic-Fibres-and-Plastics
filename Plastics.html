            Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials that use polymers as a main
            ingredient. In plastics, the arrangement of the individual units may be linear or cross-linked.
            <br>
            1. Cross-linked polymers- These polymers have side chains or cross-links, which connect different polymer
            chains.
            <br>
            2. Linear polymers- In linear polymers, the monomers are linked linearly to each other.
            <br>
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>Depending on their physical properties there are two types of plastics: Thermoplastics and Thermosetting
            plastics.
            <br>
            <br>
            a) Thermoplastics:
            <br>
            • Linear and lightly cross-linked polymers form a class of plastics called thermoplastics.
            <br>
            • They are much tougher and they have much better inter laminar strength and resistance to
            impact.
            <br>
            • Thermoplastics can be melted by heating and thereafter moulded into desired shapes. This is a
            reversible process.
            <br>
            • They absorb much less moisture with less consequential reduction in elevated temperature
            mechanical properties.
            <br>
            • PVC(polyvinyl chloride) and LDPE(low-density polyethylene) are examples of thermoplastics.
            <br>
            <br>
            b) Thermosetting Plastics
            <br>
            • Heavy cross-linking polymers after shaping the plastic form a class of plastics
            called thermosetting plastics.
            <br>
            • Their tensile strength is high and the melting points of thermosetting plastics are high.
            <br>
            • Unlike thermoplastics, thermosetting plastics cannot be remolded after reheating.
            <br>
            • Thermosets have a brittle structure and lack the ductile qualities of thermoplastics.
            <br>
            • Because of their cross-linked molecular structure, thermosets have more stiffness and
            superior mechanical properties than thermoplastics.
            <br>
            • Melamine and bakelite are examples of thermosetting plastics.
