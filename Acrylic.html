        Acrylic fibers are synthetic fibers made from a polymer. They are also called Orlon and Arcilian, closely
        resemble wool.
        <br>
        <br>
        Acrylic is a transparent plastic material with outstanding strength, stiffness, and optical clarity. Acrylic
        sheet is easy to fabricate, bonds well with adhesives and solvents, and is easy to thermoform. It has superior
        weathering properties compared to many other transparent plastics.

        Benefits of Acrylic:
        <br>
        ⦁	Easily washed, retains shape.
        <br>
        ⦁	 Resistance to moth, chemicals and oil. Superior resistance to sunlight degradation.
        <br>
        ⦁Retains color well, has a woollike texture, and is resistant to wrinkling.
        <br>
        <br>
        Uses of Acrylic fabric:
        <br> 
        ⦁	Sweaters, socks, fleece wear, circular knit apparel, sportswear and  Carpet, blankets. 
        <br>
        ⦁Fabrics made of acrylic fiber are made by processing acrylonitrile, which is a synthetic polymer.
        <br>
        ⦁The production of this form of fiber involves the reaction of certain chemicals derived from petroleum or coal with a range of monomers. As a result, the acrylic fabric is a type of fiber that is derived from fossil fuels.
        <br>
        ⦁Acrylic material is sometimes referred to as "cheap wool."
