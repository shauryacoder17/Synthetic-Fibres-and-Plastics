        What are Synthetic Fibres
    </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      Synthetic fibres are fibers made by humans through chemical synthesis, as opposed to natural fibers that are
      directly derived from living organisms, such as plants or fur from animals.
      <br>
      <br>
      Most fibres are obtained from coal, petroleum and natural gas.
      <br>
      <br>
      Examples- Rayon, Nylon, Polyester, Acrylic and Spandex.
      <br>
      <br>
      Synthetic fibres are man-made fibres, most of them are prepared from raw material petroleum called petrochemicals.
      All fabrics are obtained from fibres, while fibres are obtained from artificial or man-made sources.

      <p style="color: aqua ;">
        Rayon is a semi-synthetic fiber, made from natural sources of regenerated cellulose, such as wood and related
        agricultural products. It is also called artificial silk.
        <br>
        <br>
        Many types and grades of viscose fibers and films exist. Some imitate the feel and texture of natural fibers
        such
        as silk, wool, cotton, and linen. The types that resemble silk are often called artificial silk.

        - Nylon is a silk-like thermoplastic, generally made from petroleum, that can be melt-processed into fibers,
        films, or shapes. It was first produced in early 1930s by the scientists at the DuPont Company.

        - Polyester is a category of polymers that contain the ester functional group in every repeat unit of their main
        chain. The most used Polyester is Terylene. It is blended with natural fibres to improve its properties.
        Terrycot,
        a blend of Terylene and cotton has good absorbing power.
        <br>
        <br>
        Natural polyesters and a few synthetic ones are biodegradable, but most synthetic polyesters are not. Synthetic
        polyesters are used extensively in clothing.

        Acrylic fibers are synthetic fibers made from a polymer. They are also called Orlon and Arcilian, closely
        resemble wool.
        <br>
        <br>
        Acrylic is a transparent plastic material with outstanding strength, stiffness, and optical clarity. Acrylic
        sheet is easy to fabricate, bonds well with adhesives and solvents, and is easy to thermoform. It has superior
        weathering properties compared to many other transparent plastics.

      <p style="color: rgb(179, 182, 102) ;">
        Spandex, Lycra, or elastane is a synthetic fiber known for its exceptional elasticity. It was invented by the
        DuPont chemist Joseph Shivers in 1959.
        <br>
        <br>
        In 2014, it was noted that most clothes containing spandex end up as non-recyclable waste once they have been
        worn out, because fabric blends containing spandex are difficult to recycle. This contributes to the
        pollution of the environment.
